# WaterShader
A simple water shader for the standard pipeline for Unity. It's basically just a baseline, I'd highly recommend to improve it yourself!

This water used Voronoi Noise, if you want to know the specfics of how it works I'd recommend reading up on it since I'm not a noise expert.

PARAMETERS:
Color = The base color of the water 
BorderColor = The ripple color
TimeScale = How fast the ripples grow, move, and how fast the waves move
CellSize = This changes how many cells are in the water shader, and for looks this basically just makes the ripples smaller
NoiseStrength = The strength of the noise affecting the color
Alpha = The transparency of the water
Modifier = How far up/down the waves go

Im planning to update this as I add more to it!
